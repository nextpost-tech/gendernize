# Gendernize

Introducing a Python project that uses OpenCV to detect gender and age of an individual through webcam or image processing. The project is designed to provide an easy-to-use, efficient, and accurate way to extract user information by analyzing facial features.

The project works by utilizing computer vision techniques such as face detection, facial feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to derive age and gender classification. It is built on the OpenCV library which is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
